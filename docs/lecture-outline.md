# Lecture Outline

## Title
**Descriptive Data Analysis**  
Course: Quantitative Research Methods

## Target Audience
Master Degree students (e.g., social sciences, business) with basic research knowledge but no advanced statistics.

## Time Investment
1 week (2-hour lecture + 1-hour exercise = 3 hours total)

## Summary
This module covers the fundamental techniques for summarizing and describing a dataset. We will explore measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range), and learn how to visualize data using histograms and box plots. Students will gain practical skills in selecting appropriate descriptive statistics for different data types and interpreting results in research contexts.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Understand the purpose of descriptive vs. inferential statistics**  
   Application: Distinguish when to use descriptive versus inferential methods in research projects.

2. **Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)**  
   Application: Summarize datasets and communicate typical values in research reports.

3. **Calculate and interpret measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)**  
   Application: Assess data variability and spread in quantitative research.

4. **Create and interpret basic data visualizations (histograms, box plots)**  
   Application: Visualize distributions and identify patterns, outliers, and data characteristics.

5. **Identify the appropriate descriptive statistic for different data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)**  
   Application: Select correct statistical measures based on variable measurement levels in research design.
