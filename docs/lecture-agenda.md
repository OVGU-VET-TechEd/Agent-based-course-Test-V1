# Lecture Agenda

## Overview

Welcome to **Descriptive Data Analysis**! 📊

This module is your friendly introduction to making sense of data. Over the course of one week (3 hours total), we'll demystify those mysterious numbers and turn you into confident data storytellers. No scary math, I promise—just practical skills you'll actually use in your research!

**Learning Objectives:**
By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe your data like a pro, choose the right statistics for different types of variables, and create visualizations that actually communicate something meaningful. Think of it as learning the language of data.

**Didactic Approach:**
We're mixing things up! The 2-hour lecture combines clear explanations with real-world examples (including my own statistical blunders—you'll learn from my mistakes!), while the 1-hour exercise session gives you hands-on practice with actual datasets. Expect pair work, discussion, and plenty of "aha moments."

**Course Type:**
This is an **introductory, application-oriented** module. We're building your statistical foundation step-by-step, focusing on what you'll actually need for your research projects. Perfect for anyone who thinks "I'm not a math person" (spoiler: you don't need to be!).

## Modules / Sessions

### Session 01 – Making Sense of Data: Central Tendency & Dispersion (Lecture)
**Type:** Lecture  
**Duration:** 120 minutes  
**Materials File:** `materials/01-lecture.md`

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the purpose of descriptive vs. inferential statistics
- Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Calculate and interpret measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)
- Identify the appropriate descriptive statistic for different data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)

**Summary:**
Here's where we get friendly with numbers! We'll start by understanding why we even bother with statistics (hint: it's about telling stories with data, not torturing students). Then we'll dive into the "Big Three" of central tendency—mean, median, and mode. I like to think of them as different ways of answering "What's typical here?" 

Next up: dispersion measures. These tell us if our data points are best friends huddling together or scattered across the universe. We'll tackle variance, standard deviation, and range using examples like test scores, salaries, and pizza delivery times (because why not?).

Finally, we'll crack the code on data types. Not all variables are created equal! We'll learn when to use which statistic depending on whether you're dealing with categories (like favorite ice cream flavors), rankings (like race positions), or actual numbers (like temperatures). By the end, you'll know exactly which tool to grab from your statistical toolbox.

Lots of examples, visual aids, and opportunities to ask "Wait, what?" when things get fuzzy. We're all learning together!

### Session 02 – Seeing is Believing: Data Visualization in Action (Exercise)
**Type:** Exercise  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Materials File:** `materials/02-exercise.md`

**Learning Objectives:**
- Create and interpret basic data visualizations (histograms, box plots)
- Apply all learned concepts to real research datasets
- Identify patterns, outliers, and data characteristics visually

**Summary:**
Time to get our hands dirty with real data! This is where everything clicks into place. We'll work with actual datasets (think survey data, experimental results, or social science research) and create visualizations that reveal what's really going on.

You'll build histograms to see the shape of your data (Is it a nice bell curve? Skewed like a ski slope? Bimodal like a camel's back?). Then we'll tackle box plots—those nifty diagrams that show you the median, quartiles, and sneaky outliers at a glance.

This is a collaborative session, so you'll work in pairs or small groups. I'll circulate, answer questions, and help troubleshoot when Excel or your calculator decides to be difficult. We'll share our findings, discuss what we see, and celebrate those beautiful "I get it now!" moments.

By the time we wrap up, you'll have created your own data visualizations and gained the confidence to describe any dataset that comes your way. Plus, you'll have practical examples you can immediately apply to your own research!

**Total Time:** 180 minutes (3 hours)

**Note:** Both sessions build on each other, so the lecture gives you the concepts and the exercise lets you immediately practice. This isn't "sit and listen"—it's "learn and do"! 🚀
