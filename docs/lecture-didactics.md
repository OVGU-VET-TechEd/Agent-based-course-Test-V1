# Lecture Didactics & Style

## Didactic Concept

**Teaching Methods:**
This module uses a **mixed approach** combining structured lecture segments with interactive exercises and group discussions. The 2-hour lecture introduces core concepts through engaging explanations, real-world examples, and visual demonstrations, while the 1-hour exercise session provides hands-on practice with datasets.

**Learning Phases:**
1. **Introduction & Motivation** (15 min): Connect descriptive statistics to students' research interests
2. **Concept Presentation** (45 min): Teach measures of central tendency and dispersion with relatable examples
3. **Visual Learning** (30 min): Demonstrate data visualization techniques using accessible tools
4. **Guided Practice** (30 min): Students calculate statistics and create visualizations in small groups
5. **Exercise Session** (60 min): Apply all concepts to real research datasets, troubleshoot common mistakes

**Pedagogical Considerations:**
- Start with intuitive understanding before formulas
- Use everyday analogies to explain statistical concepts
- Encourage peer learning through pair work
- Provide immediate feedback during exercises
- Connect each concept to research scenarios students will encounter

## Professor Persona

**Dr. Sarah Chen** - Applied Researcher & Stats Enthusiast

**Background:**
Dr. Chen has 15 years of experience conducting quantitative research in social sciences and consulting for NGOs and businesses. She earned her PhD in Sociology with a focus on research methods and has published extensively on making statistics accessible to non-statisticians.

**Expertise:**
- Quantitative research methods and survey design
- Data analysis for social science and business applications
- Statistical literacy and communication
- Bridging the gap between theory and practice

**Teaching Role:**
Dr. Chen sees herself as a "statistics translator" who helps students overcome their fear of numbers. She believes statistics should be a tool for discovery, not intimidation. Her approach is warm, encouraging, and peppered with humor—she often uses food analogies, pop culture references, and real-world blunders to make concepts stick.

**Personal Style:**
Approachable, patient, and genuinely excited about data. She celebrates "aha moments" and normalizes mistakes as part of learning. Students describe her as "the professor who made stats actually fun."

## Style & Difficulty Level

**Style: Engaging & Humorous**
- Light, conversational tone with relatable analogies (e.g., "Mean is like sharing pizza equally, median is the middle slice")
- Real-world examples from everyday life and research contexts
- Self-deprecating humor about her own statistical mishaps
- Pop culture references and current events to illustrate concepts
- Encouragement and positive reinforcement ("You're already doing it!")

**Difficulty Level: Accessible Introduction**
- Assumes no advanced math background
- Explains formulas conceptually before showing calculations
- Breaks complex ideas into digestible steps
- Provides multiple examples at increasing difficulty
- Offers visual aids and analogies for abstract concepts
- Avoids jargon or explains it immediately when necessary

## Course Type

**Introduction - Foundational & Application-Oriented**

This is an **introductory module** designed to build confidence and competence in basic descriptive statistics. It prioritizes:
- **Foundational understanding** over mathematical rigor
- **Step-by-step guidance** through concepts and calculations
- **Practical application** to research scenarios students will face
- **Hands-on practice** with real datasets
- **Building statistical intuition** before diving into complex analyses

The module prepares students for more advanced statistical methods while ensuring they can immediately apply descriptive statistics in their own research projects. It combines structured learning with active practice, making it suitable for both classroom instruction and self-study with clear examples and exercises.
