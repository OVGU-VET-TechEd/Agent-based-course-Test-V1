# Session 01 – Making Sense of Data: Central Tendency & Dispersion (Lecture)

## Summary
This 2-hour lecture session introduces students to the fundamentals of descriptive statistics. Building on the course's engaging and accessible approach, this session demystifies statistical measures through relatable examples and visual demonstrations. Students will learn to distinguish descriptive from inferential statistics, master measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range), and understand when to use which statistic based on data types. This session connects directly to the agenda's goal of building statistical confidence and prepares students for the hands-on exercise session that follows.

**Connection to Agenda:** First of two sessions; provides foundational concepts before practical application.  
**Relevance:** Essential for any research involving data description and analysis.  
**Didactics:** Mixed approach with lecture, examples, visual aids, and brief pair discussions.

## Content
**Main Topics:**

1. **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics** (15 min)
   - Placeholder for introduction and motivation
   - Why we describe data before making inferences
   
2. **Measures of Central Tendency** (45 min)
   - Mean: concept, calculation, interpretation
