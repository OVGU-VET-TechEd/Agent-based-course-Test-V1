# Session 02 – Seeing is Believing: Data Visualization in Action (Exercise)

## Summary
This 1-hour hands-on exercise session allows students to immediately apply all concepts learned in the lecture. Working with real research datasets, students will calculate descriptive statistics, create visualizations (histograms and box plots), and interpret their findings. The session emphasizes collaborative learning through pair work, practical troubleshooting, and sharing discoveries. This session directly builds on Session 01's theoretical foundation and transforms abstract concepts into concrete skills students can use in their own research projects.

**Connection to Agenda:** Second of two sessions; applies lecture concepts through practice.  
**Relevance:** Bridges theory and practice; builds confidence with real data analysis.  
**Didactics:** Hands-on workshop format with guided practice, peer collaboration, and instructor support.
